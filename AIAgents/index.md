# Learning Path For Building Autonomous Agents
## Phase 1: The Foundation (Python Proficiency)

## Phase 2: Phase 2: The Brain (LLMs & APIs)
Understand how to "talk" to the models programmatically before adding complexity.

## Phase 3: The Tools (RAG & Function Calling)
This is the tipping point where a "chatbot" becomes an "agent." You will teach the AI to use external tools.

## Phase 4: The Agent Architect (Orchestration Frameworks)
Now you build systems where the AI plans multi-step tasks.
