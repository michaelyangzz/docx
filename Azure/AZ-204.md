# App Service
- When deployed to built-in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage. The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem. Apps that require heavy read-only access to content files might benefit from the custom container option, which places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume.
# App Service Environment
- App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps. It offers improved security at high scale.

- Unlike the App Service offering, where supporting infrastructure is shared, with App Service Environment, compute is dedicated to a single customer. For more information on the differences between App Service Environment and App Service
